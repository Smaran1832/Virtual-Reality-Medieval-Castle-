My project is a google cardboard build for android. I used Unity 2019 version as I couldn't understand how to perform the Task in the updated version of Unity. Our course is also based on the older 2019 version with VR supported version. I have an apk file attached for Android Users. It is a castle in a green field with a clear sky with a humanoid interactable figure.


Instructions
-Switch on the developer mode on your android device by finding and clicking on your developer build number 7 times 
-Switch on the USB debugging 
-Download the Apk file on your android phone.
-Run the Unity model icon named as Fantasy Castle 
-A VR view of the castle will be seen. Move your Phone.
-Looking Down at the ground in the direction you want to move will make the character move
-The Four Pillars are teleport point clicking on the screen while looking at them will allow you to teleport to them
-Click the human figure when camera pointing to it to start the interaction
-After the welcome dailogue if you nod or shake the human will perform a different dance assigned to the action
-Press the home button to exist whenever you feel like it.

Requirements: 
-Android kitkat or above 
-Developer mode enabled 
-A carboard holder if needed though the app will give you the idea even without it. 
I do think it would run on most android phones (provided the developer options are enabled) the target device I used is Samsung Galaxy s9+ and it runs fine with the APK installation
